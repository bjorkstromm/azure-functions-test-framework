# Known Issues

For current capabilities, package layout, and common commands, see `README.md`. This file is intentionally limited to active blockers and known issues.

## Active blockers

- No active blockers for the current Worker SDK 2.x sample/test suites.

## Known issues

- `FunctionsTestHostBuilder.ConfigureEnvironmentVariable(name, value)` sets process-level environment variables, so tests that need different values for the same variable name should not run in parallel.
- The durable support package currently uses a framework-owned fake path (`ConfigureFakeDurableSupport(...)` + `FunctionsDurableClientProvider`) instead of the real Durable runtime and execution engine.
- `AzureFunctions.TestFramework.Http` is still a minimal package with little public surface area today; it is packed/published so the package set stays stable while HTTP-specific helpers are added later.
